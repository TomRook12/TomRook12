So where to start with this what is vibe coding? How do you Vibe Code? How do you do it in Salesforce? Should you be doing? Why would you do it? This is what this post looks to tackle its going to he semi instructional semi-opinion piece and hopefully mildly interesting. 

## What is Vibe Coding?
So lets start off with the big one What is vibe coding? Vibe coding is this process of using an AI and english languge to create code based on the ~vibes~, the excitement, the energy. Or as it is normally known plain text prompts into a LLM of your choosing. It is an accessible way for non technical users to produce software, putting coding on the hands of almost anyone who can get access to the code base.

## Agentforce Vibes
I think it is important that i get my opinion across here so you understand my angle, I really like this technology, i think it is fun to use and can actually generate some usable code and as someone that isnt a developer I love having that powerin my hands. I have used what i am going to talk about, with medium success in the past few months. I have tried the various models that are out there, Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft CoPilot (the corporate one) and GitHub Copilot but one LLM stood out head and shoulders above the others and that was Salesforce's Agentforce Plugin for VSCode. Now you might be thinking "Tom doesnt agentforce just send data out to one of the big LLM providers" and you would right that is what it does on Platform but we arent on Platform here...

We are actually interfacing with Salesforces own, open source LLM, built from the ground up for writing the Launges in Salesforce. And creating Apex Classes, Test Classes ,Lightning Web Components and Aura Components and Test Classes. Super duper cool.



So what does it look like in Salesforce? Something on ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude? For that we need to hop into VScode and install the agentforce extension.
