A few years ago I was working on a project that required rapid protyping of various Salesforce features, the person we were presenting to loved emaii templates amd the software we were looking to replace contained 150+ of the things. So alot of email templates were getting created, this created a problem. My prefered email creation solution is Lightning Email Templates, but Salesforce still prefers to run with classic email templates in many places. For instance in flow it is getting better at supporting email but it still doesnt offer the WYSIWYG functionality that I love about Lightning Email Templates. 

What do I want to do about this? Well this problem is, has occured in multiple orgs and the cross org solution is... an app store app!
