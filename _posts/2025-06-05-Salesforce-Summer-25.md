Another 3rd of a year, another Salesforce release! This time it is the turn of the Summer '25 release, bringing it with a whole host of features. Dive into this Quickfire of my favourite things, in no particular order:

### Salesforce Go

Not to be confused with Pokemon Go, offers a view into what features you have access to, how to set those features up and what features you could have if you had a little bit more money. A really interesting place to explore available for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Field Service Lightning.

### Object Cred

Salesforce have really been trying to bring together improved views of CRED rights across different parts of the platform this releae is no different, now you can see and crucially update CRED rights for an object from the Object Manager. Simply Navigate to Setup > Object Manager > Object of Your Choice > Object Access for a handy dandy break down of the Profiles and Permisions that access the object and the level of access they provide.

### Permission Sets

Following on from the theme of enhanced visibility of CRED right, the user access summary is a great place to understand what is giving your user access, it is now even better with the ability to add and remove a user from Perrsion Sets, Public Groups and Queues from right inside the summary! Less clicking is always better!

### Flow Approvals

Originally a paid feature but as of Spring '25 a free and by the looks of this release the future of Salesforce Approvals, this release is all about feature parity with recall paths, the ability to run approvals from flows, delegate support and a super useful wizard. A free feature with more functionality than when it was paid, whats not to like?

### Employee Agent

More agentforce updates than you can shake a stick at but my favourite is the employeee agent, a guided setup for an agent that can help users solve internal problems. These updates are also dropping monthly, you can find a monthly releae notes section at the top of the release notes table of contents.

### Case Closing 

Close a case with one button, the confusingly named 'Close Case' button. I don't know what else to say here, add it to a detail page and go wild!

### Summary

A great release with lots of fun feature, the Flow Approvals gets my vote as the most exciting. Think of all the fantastically complicated processes you can accomodate... actually not sure if that is a good thing.
