Hello! I'm Tom Rook, an experienced Salesforce Consultant & Business Analyst with a real passion for empowering users to get the most out of their Salesforce implementation. I believe in driving value through strong stakeholder engagement and developing a deep, empathetic understanding of end users. My approach is further strengthened by my own experience as a Salesforce end-user, which allows me to truly deliver solutions that meet client needs.

My key strengths lie in crafting declarative solutions, effective stakeholder management, meticulous requirements gathering, detailed process mapping, and expert Salesforce configuration. I've had the opportunity to work across diverse projects, from implementing new solutions for managing customer data and migrating legacy systems to optimizing automation and delivering impactful training workshops.

Outside of my professional life, I am an active member of the London Admin Users Group and enjoy running, cycling, and spending time with my young family. And, for those who share my enthusiasm, I'm always up for a conversation about all things coffee!
